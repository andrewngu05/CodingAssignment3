/*
PURPOSE:

Knowledge:

    o Understand the mechanics of completing exercises for this class
	o Understand the SQL syntax for retrieving data from single database tables

Skills:

    o Outside of class, access a computer that has SQL Server loaded on it
    o Interpret questions to understand how to answer the questions
    o Write SQL queries to answer questions by retrieving data from a single database table

TASK:

    1. Download the following SQL file and rename it DEV140-Assignment-02, where Xxxxx is your last and first name. 
	
    2. Open the file in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

    3. Add your SQL code in the space provided below each question. The questions are written as comments so they will not execute in SQL Server. 

    4. Proofread your document to make sure all questions are answered completely and that it is easy to distinguish your responses from the questions on the page.

    5. Return to this Exercise page, attach your completed file, and submit.

 

CRITERIA:

    o Answer all the questions
    o If you do not understand a question, did you post your question on the DB, ask for help from 
	  a classmate, or a tutor?
    o Your answer/query is in the right place underneath the question
    o Your answer/query is not commented out
    o Your answer/query executes without an error
    o You have renamed the file as specified above and submitted it via Canvas
    o If you cannot complete the Exercise, did you communicate with the teacher (before the due date) so that he/she/they understands your situation?

/*	
    You are to develop SQL statements for each task listed. You should type your SQL statements under each task.
	The fields' names are written as if a person is asking you for the report. You will need to look at the data
	and understand that list price is in the ListPrice field, for example.
	Add comments to describe your reasoning when you are in doubt about something. 


    For this Assignment, we will use the MyGuitarShop database. We tell SQL Server which database 
    to use via the USE statement.

    Do not remove the USE statement.
